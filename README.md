Description
In this competition, participants will explore and analyze the Diabetes Dataset, a well-known dataset in the medical domain. This competition aims to test participants' abilities across multiple machine learning paradigms, including regression, classification, and unsupervised learning.
**
Domain Background**
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Proper management of diabetes is crucial to prevent serious complications, and machine learning can play a significant role in predicting and managing the disease. The dataset used in this competition contains various medical measurements, which will serve as the basis for predicting disease progression and risk categorization.

Tasks Overview Regression Task
In the regression task, participants will predict the progression of diabetes (Y) one year after baseline measurements. This task tests the ability to model continuous outcomes and understand the factors that contribute to disease progression.
**
Classification Task**
The classification task involves predicting whether a patient is at "high risk" or "low risk" based on their medical measurements. This binary classification task requires participants to identify which factors are most indicative of high or low risk.
**
Unsupervised Learning Task**
For the unsupervised learning task, participants will cluster patients based on their baseline medical measurements without considering the target variable. This task will challenge participants to uncover hidden patterns in the data that may provide new insights into patient segmentation.

Technical Details Data
The dataset consists of several medical features, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The target variable (Y) represents a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Formatting Guidelines
To ensure your submissions are correctly formatted, please provide clean code , well commented and organized.

This competition is designed to challenge your machine learning skills across different tasks. Whether you're building a regression model, a classifier, or exploring unsupervised methods, you'll gain valuable insights into the application of these techniques in the medical domain.

Good luck, and we look forward to your participation!

Evaluation
Participants' submissions will be evaluated based on the three distinct tasks in this competition: regression, classification, and unsupervised learning. Each task has its own evaluation metric and submission format. Below are the details for each:

Regression Task
Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Explanation: The regression task will be evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual target values. A lower MSE indicates better performance.

Classification Task
Metric: Accuracy and ROC-AUC
Explanation: The classification task will be evaluated based on Accuracy and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions, while ROC-AUC evaluates the quality of the classification by considering both the true positive and false positive rates.

Unsupervised Learning Task
Metric: Silhouette Score
Explanation: The unsupervised learning task will be evaluated using the Silhouette Score, which measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher Silhouette Score indicates better-defined clusters.

Submission Guidelines
File Naming: Ensure that each submission file is correctly named according to the task (e.g., regression_submission.csv, classification_submission.csv, clustering_submission.csv).

Submission Limits: You may submit up to 1 times per day for each task. Only your best submission will be considered for the leaderboard.

Leaderboard: The leaderboard will be updated based on your best submission for each task.
Important Notes

Consistency: Ensure that the Id values in your submissions match the test dataset provided.

File Format: All submissions must be in CSV format, with the specified column names and order.
This structure provides a clear and detailed explanation of how submissions will be evaluated, including the metrics used and the required format for each task.
