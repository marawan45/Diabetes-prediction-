🧠 Diabetes Machine Learning Competition
📌 Project Description
This project explores the Diabetes Dataset, a well-known medical dataset, and challenges participants to apply regression, classification, and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and model disease progression. The primary aim is to build robust ML pipelines to help in predicting disease progression, categorizing patient risk, and discovering hidden patterns in patient data.

🧬 Domain Background
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the body’s ability to process blood glucose. If left unmanaged, it can lead to severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. Using machine learning techniques, we can analyze medical features to:

Predict disease progression

Identify high-risk individuals

Segment patients based on health metrics

🔍 Tasks Overview
📉 Regression Task
Objective: Predict disease progression (Y) one year after baseline.

Challenge: Model continuous outcomes using features like age, BMI, and blood serum measurements.

Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE) — lower is better.

⚠️ Classification Task
Objective: Classify patients as High Risk or Low Risk.

Challenge: Determine which features are most indicative of high-risk status.

Metrics:

Accuracy — proportion of correctly predicted labels

ROC-AUC — quality of classification based on sensitivity vs. specificity

🧪 Unsupervised Learning Task
Objective: Cluster patients using baseline medical data (excluding target Y).

Challenge: Discover hidden patient groups that may reflect disease patterns or progression stages.

Metric: Silhouette Score — higher indicates better-defined clusters.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following features:

Feature	Description
Age	Age of the patient
Sex	Gender
BMI	Body Mass Index
BP	Average blood pressure
S1 to S6	Six blood serum measurements (standardized)
Y	Target variable — disease progression

Target variable Y is used in regression and classification tasks. It is excluded in the unsupervised task.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
